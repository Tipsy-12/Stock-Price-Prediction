Overview

This project focuses on forecasting stock prices(Asian Paints,Tata Steel,Apple,etc) and modeling volatility using time series techniques. It combines ARIMA for stock price prediction and GARCH for volatility forecasting. The workflow includes exploratory data analysis, stationarity testing, model optimization, and walk-forward validation for robust forecasting.

Key Highlights

1. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand trends and volatility behavior in stock data.

2. Tested for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test.

3. Built and optimized an ARIMA model for time series forecasting of stock prices.

4. Applied a GARCH model to capture time-varying volatility and volatility clustering.

5. Performed walk-forward validation to evaluate model performance over rolling time windows.

Results

1. ARIMA effectively captured short-term price dynamics.

2. GARCH successfully modeled periods of high and low volatility.

3. Walk-forward validation ensured robust and realistic forecasts.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for financial time series forecasting. By integrating ARIMA and GARCH models, it addresses both trend forecasting and risk modeling. The approach is well-suited for analyzing real-world stock data where volatility and trend co-exist.
